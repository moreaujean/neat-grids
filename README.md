# Bourbon Smash / Neat Grids

Hey there! We're [thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com), a design and
development consultancy that brings your digital product ideas to life.
We also love to share what we learn.

This coding exercise comes from [Upcase](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase),
the online learning platform we run. It's part of the
[Bourbon Smash](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/bourbon-smash) course and is just one small sample of all
the great material available on Upcase, so be sure to visit and check out the rest.

## Exercise Intro

Use Neat to update our photo gallery to have a responsive grid.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/neat-grids.git
    cd neat-grids
    bin/setup

You can run the provided code with:

    bundle exec middleman server

Your goal is to implement a responsive grid, approximately matching the provided example. You'll need to define your grid settings, use Neat's mixins to establish the grid, and use media queries to alter the layout for various device widths. (You can use 1200px for the overall max-width, and 700px and 900px for the break points)

**Note** You should not need to alter the provided HTML to implement the grid (how nice and semantic!)

## Tips and Tricks

Be sure to revisit the [Neat Introduction video](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/videos/neat-semantic-grids) in the Bourbon Smash trail, as well as the [Neat docs](http://thoughtbot.github.io/neat-docs/latest/) for reference.
